## Developing

The development branch is `main`. This is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against. The changes on the `main`
branch are tagged into a release monthly.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your
   own GitHub account and then
   [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

3. Install yarn:

   ```sh
   npm install -g yarn
   ```

4. Install the dependencies with:

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

5. Set up your `.env` file:

   - Duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate a key and add it under `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.
   - Use `openssl rand -base64 24` to generate a key and add it under `CALENDSO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in the `.env` file.

6. Start developing and watch for code changes:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

## Building
